**User Stories**

1. “As a Dungeon Master, I want to press a single button to populate a city so that I can prepare for a Dungeons & Dragons session quickly.”

2. “As someone who doesn’t have their computer at a D&D session, I want to be able to easily print a copy of my city so that I can have a physical copy in front of me that I can write on.

**Use Cases**

1. Given three size options (small, medium, large) and three city types (village, town, city), when the user selects the specific parameters for their desired city, then the application will deliver a fully populated city filled with categories appropriate to those parameters.

2. Given that a city has already been generated, when a user selects the “export as Word doc” option, then a downloadable Word document will be generated containing the information displayed on the web page.

3. Given that a city has already been generated, when a user would like to customize the name or parameters of an element, then they will be able to do so by selecting the arrow at the end of the element.

4. Given a non-player character, when the NPC is of a certain fantasy race (e.g. Dwarf), then the randomly generated name will be appropriate for that race (e.g. Scottish-sounding for a Dwarf).
