Jericho is a web application created using Microsoftâ€™s .NET Framework which generates a fantasy city populated with a number of named buildings appropriate to the size of locale specified by the user. The buildings are sorted by the category they fall under (government, religion, market, etc) and include at least one named occupant. 

The concept of Jericho was inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a tabletop role-playing game which typically takes place in a fantasy setting populated by sprawling cities host to humans, dwarves, elves, and other fantasy creatures. Jericho aims to assist D&D players who wish to populate their own fantasy setting with unique cities full of interesting characters, but who may not want to take the time to come up with everything from scratch.
