Hovering the cursor over "Generate New" item will display a drop down list with the options:

 - Village
 - Town
 - City
 
 Hovering over one of these options will display a second drop down list with the options:
 
 - Small
 - Medium
 - Large

When a user clicks on the desired size, a city of those parameters will automatically be populated. 

The downward arrows will allow the user to customize that information, and the plus signs ( + ) will add another section of that type for customization.

The "Save As" link will allow the user to save a local copy of the city with the current parameters, and the "Export As" link will export the city with the current parameters into a Word document.
